Framework-agnostic manager for algorithms, equations, and data processing tasks. Turn raw data into gold.

*According to myth, Midas was a man bestowed with a golden hand that would transform all he touched to gold. Midas-Data does the same for your data sets. Just don't turn your wife to gold.*

This package is in the early development stages.

## Goals
  * Ability to load algorithms and equations, and then solve given parameters
  * Ability to filter, validate, and marshal data in an immutable way. (input one structure, output another)
  * Ability to nest and chain algorithms and equations
  * Save and reuse datasets and algorithms
  * Stream data through commands and algorithms
  * Create a DataObject that can save its own version history
  * Use Outputters to format output for CLI, HTTP, Etc
